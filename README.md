## Introduction
Cyclistic is a bike-share company in Chicago. In this project, I analyzed their data to help understand how casual riders and annual members use their bikes differently. I also created visualizations to communicate our findings to stakeholders.

## Data
The data was obtained from the Cyclistic Divvy data website, and contains information on bike trips taken between 2022 and 2023. We used a sample dataset for the year 2022. The dataset includes information such as trip duration, start and end times and locations, and rider type (casual or member).

## Methodology
We first cleaned the data, removing any duplicates or missing values. We then conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify any patterns or trends. Next, we created visualizations to communicate our findings, using tools such as Tableau and Matplotlib. Finally, we drew conclusions based on our analysis and made recommendations for Cyclistic.

## Results
Our analysis revealed that annual members use the bikes more often and for shorter durations, while casual riders use the bikes less frequently but for longer durations. We also found that bike usage was highest during the summer months, and on weekdays between 7-9am and 4-6pm. Our recommendations included marketing strategies on summer, weekends, electric bikes and classic bikes to increase annual membership and to offer promotions during non-peak months and date to encourage more bike usage.

## Usage
To run the code, open the `cyclistic_case_study.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Dependencies
The code was written in Python 3 and requires the following packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- folium

The visualizations were created using Tableau and can be viewed in the `cyclistic_dashboard.twb` file.
